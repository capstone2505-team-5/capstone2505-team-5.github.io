  <p>LLMonade is an open-source AI evaluation tool that helps small development teams systematically improve their LLM-integrated applications through guided, manual error analysis. Instead of guessing what's wrong with your AI application, our streamlined interface pulls your real trace data, lets you quickly annotate outputs, automatically categorize failure patterns, and identify the highest ROI fixes. We make the proven best practice of manual error analysis accessible to teams with limited resources and new to AI evaluations.</p>
