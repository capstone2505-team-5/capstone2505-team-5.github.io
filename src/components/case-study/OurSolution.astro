  <h3 id="introducing-llmonade">Introducing LLMonade</h3>
  <p>LLMonade is a free, lightweight, self-hosted platform that guides developers of LLM-powered applications through their first evaluations.  Our software is designed for small engineering teams that have already instrumented their application with Phoenix.  Traces are being collected, but the developers don’t know where to start assessing and improving the quality of their application.  LLMonade pulls traces from Phoenix and provides an annotation interface inspired by Hamel Husain’s recommendations.  Then, guides the developer through the most important evaluation activity, manual error analysis.</p>

  <p>LLMonade walks users through a simplified five step workflow to quickly get started evaluating their application. This simplified workflow reflects Hamel Husain’s best practices for error analysis.  The inspection results provide data driven targets for developers to focus on.  Progress through the workflow is visually tracked in a persistent footer. It highlights the current error analysis step and clearly indicates what comes next, ensuring users new to evaluations can navigate the process with ease. </p>

  <h3>Development Process</h3>
  <p>
    Our development process followed an iterative approach with regular feedback 
    loops and continuous integration. This ensured that we could quickly adapt 
    to changing requirements and user feedback.
