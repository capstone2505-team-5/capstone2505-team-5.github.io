  <h3 id="observability-of-traditional-apps">Observability of Traditional Apps</h3>
  <p>
    Traditional applications follow well-established patterns for observability. 
    These applications typically have predictable request flows, clear error boundaries, 
    and structured data that makes monitoring and debugging straightforward.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <h4>Key Highlights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Comprehensive user research with 50+ participants</li>
      <li>Iterative design process with 3 major iterations</li>
      <li>40% improvement in user satisfaction scores</li>
      <li>25% reduction in task completion time</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>Key Characteristics</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictable request/response patterns</li>
      <li>Structured error handling</li>
      <li>Clear data flow boundaries</li>
      <li>Established monitoring patterns</li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="ai-llms-and-llm-based-apps">AI, LLMs, and LLM-based Apps</h3>
  <p>
    The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered applications 
    has introduced new challenges for observability. These applications often 
    have non-deterministic outputs, complex reasoning chains, and unique 
    performance characteristics.
  </p>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>New Challenges</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-deterministic outputs</li>
      <li>Complex reasoning chains</li>
      <li>Variable response times</li>
      <li>Context-dependent behavior</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3 id="observability-of-llm-based-apps">Observability of LLM-based Apps</h3>
  <p>
    Observing LLM-based applications requires new approaches and tools. 
    Traditional metrics like response time and error rates are still important, 
    but we need additional insights into the quality, relevance, and reasoning 
    behind AI-generated responses.
  </p>

  <div class="content-block">
    <h4>Observability Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Response quality assessment</li>
      <li>Reasoning chain analysis</li>
      <li>Token usage monitoring</li>
      <li>Context tracking</li>
    </ul>
